Description:
It is a third person shooting ball game (sort of) which lets you control the 3d ball into a 3d galactic space, with lots of other balls around you, you can shoot them, tag them, and you can also move around the scene with the jumping ball.
You can change the gravity according to your will that is just for your ball, everything else around you stay the same and use it to your advantage to move around different sides of the cubes you are standing(rolling) on.

TOTAL 7 technical things are:
1. Ray Casting
2. Portals
3. Our own Particle Generator with different behaviours and customizable particles.
4. Gravity flipping mechanism, the integration of 3rd person camera (with ease in animations) controls with variable gravity controls 
5. Lava effect on a plane using Multiple Height map and texture blending animations.
6. Tagging enemies and seeing them through walls (Inspired from far cry series)
7. Live offscreen texture of the scene that has a different color scheme than the original scene as it uses multiple passes to apply a hue difference between the image and its reflection. (Creates kind of an ‘inception of mirrors’ effect!)
